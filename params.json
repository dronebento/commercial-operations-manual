As we continue to develop our work, we are looking for passionate individuals to contribute to this project.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\nDroneBento Commercial Operations Manual is modular.  At the current stage we are seeding the files with our internal documents in GitHub's markdown.  You can download the entire library, clone it to your own GitHub repository, or even contribute to our source.  \r\n\r\nWe are here to develop and grow the UAS operator community.  Although we do operate sUAS in the Richmond area, our goal is to collect knowledge and share it with other operators. We encourage mission sharing, joint-operations, and standardization.  \r\n\r\nThe module development list is dynamic, so check back frequently. The modules we are currently working on are:\r\n- [risk management](https://github.com/dronebento/commercial-operations-manual/tree/master/modules/risk_management)\r\n- [training program](https://github.com/dronebento/commercial-operations-manual/tree/master/modules/training_program)\r\n- [mission operations](https://github.com/dronebento/commercial-operations-manual/tree/master/modules/mission_ops)\r\n- [incident management](https://github.com/dronebento/commercial-operations-manual/tree/master/modules/incident_management)\r\n- [maintenance](https://github.com/dronebento/commercial-operations-manual/tree/master/modules/maintenance_program)\r\n\r\n## Currency\r\nThe best way to know about our updates is to Star and Watch the [commercial operations manual](https://github.com/dronebento/commercial-operations-manual) project.  You can also track the [Activity Stream](https://github.com/dronebento?tab=activity).\r\n\r\n## Contributions\r\nClick on the [modules](https://github.com/dronebento/commercial-operations-manual/tree/master/modules) link view the latest list documents we provide in the master.
