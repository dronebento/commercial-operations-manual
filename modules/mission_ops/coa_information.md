#Certificates of Waiver or Authorization (COA)
COA is an authorization issued by the Air Traffic Organization to a public operator for a specific UA activity. After a complete application is submitted, FAA conducts a comprehensive operational and technical review. If necessary, provisions or limitations may be imposed as part of the approval to ensure the UA can operate safely with other airspace users. In most cases, FAA will provide a formal response within 60 days from the time a completed application is submitted.

To better support the needs of our customers, FAA deployed a web-based application system. The [COA Online System for *Small Unmanned Aerial Systems*](https://www.faa.gov/uas/request_waiver/) provides applicants with an electronic method of requesting a COA. Applicants will need to obtain an account in order to access the online system.

#Waivers to Certain Small UAS Operating Rules
The small UAS rule (14 CFR part 107) includes the option to apply for a certificate of waiver, which allows for a small UAS operation to deviate from certain operating rules if the FAA finds that the proposed operation can be performed safely.
* Waivable sections of part 107
* Operation from a moving vehicle or aircraft (§ 107.25)*
* Daylight operation (§ 107.29)
* Visual line of sight aircraft operation (§ 107.31)*
* Visual observer (§ 107.33)
* Operation of multiple small unmanned aircraft systems (§ 107.35)
* Yielding the right of way (§ 107.37(a))
* Operation over people (§ 107.39)
* Operation in certain airspace (§ 107.41)
* Operating limitations for small unmanned aircraft (§ 107.51)

_No waiver of this provision will be issued to allow the carriage of property of another by aircraft for compensation or hire._

Applicants should submit their waiver requests to the FAA as early as possible. Processing time depends on the complexity of the request; however the agency strives to respond within 90 days.

Certificates of waiver may include specific special provisions designed to ensure that the small UAS operation provides an equivalent level of safety as part 107.
