#Certificates of Waiver or Authorization (COA)
COA is an authorization issued by the Air Traffic Organization to a public operator for a specific UA activity. After a complete application is submitted, FAA conducts a comprehensive operational and technical review. If necessary, provisions or limitations may be imposed as part of the approval to ensure the UA can operate safely with other airspace users. In most cases, FAA will provide a formal response within 60 days from the time a completed application is submitted.

To better support the needs of our customers, FAA deployed a web-based application system. The [UAS COA Online System](https://ioeaaa.faa.gov/oeaaa/Welcome.jsp) provides applicants with an electronic method of requesting a COA. Applicants will need to obtain an account in order to access the online system.
