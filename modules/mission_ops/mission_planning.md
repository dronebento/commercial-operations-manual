  * Customer Terms of Service
  * Written Estimate
  * Collect Deposit
  * Scheduling
  * Equipment Assignment

##Dispatching: 48+ hours out
* Location Scout.
  * Record the scope and location of the mission.
  * Cross-reference the location area against current aviation chart and determine proximity to all airports.
  * Set mission parameters for weather conditions, flight distance, flight time.
* CREW and Incident Response Team
  * Assign crew and verify currency requirements.
  * Assign Flight Director
  * Prepare CREW and Incident Response Team communication sheet whicth contains:
    * Names, Roles & Responsibilities.

* Determine battery capabilities from logs against the scope of the mission. Assure that battery power will remain above set minimums at the end of a segment.
* Outlook Briefing. Obtain an electronic Weather Briefing, from Lockheed Martin Flight Services, for an airport within 20nm of the location where mission is flown. All tablets run ForeFlight Pro with access to key flight information.
* Obtain nearest airport CTAF frequency.
* Software updates and critical notices from manufacturer.
