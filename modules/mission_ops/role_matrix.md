#Segregation of duties
Separation of duties matrix, shown below, models how we prevent conflicts of interest within commercial missions.  Although multiple roles can be held by the same individual, the key operational roles cannot be held by a person able to plan and authorize a plan.

A minimum staff of two is required to plan and authorize a commercial mission.  A staff of five (5), with each person holding a different role is referred to as a “Full Crew”. A staff of two (2) and less than five (5) is referred to as a “Half Crew”. Training missions in practice area are exempt.

## matrix
Instructions: Each mission is planned by a minimum crew of two persons holding the key roles of PM or FD.  Use this matrix to assign the operation roles if the two individual are also operating the UAS on the mission.  Only one box can be checked per row.  Only three (3) boxes total can be checked.
