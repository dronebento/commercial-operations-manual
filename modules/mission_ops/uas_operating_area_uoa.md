# UAS Operating Area (also known as DROTAMs)
Drone notices to airmen, also known as UOA or UAS operating areas, are suprsingly easy to file.

## Getting Started
Make sure you have a [Flight Service](https://www.lmfsweb.afss.com) account.

* Access the Flight Service UOA section at https://www.lmfsweb.afss.com/Website/uoaSubmit
* Enter your Aircraft ID
* Enter your max altitude, below 400' AGL
* Select your desired operating area, usualy Circular Area is preferred.
* Collect your Center Point.
  * Visit http://www.gps-coordinates.net/
  * Enter the address and verify it shows up on the map.
  * Collect the DMS (degrees, minutes, secondes) information
  * You will transform the info from the boxes to something that looks like this DDMM/DDMM. Example, a latitude of 38 deg, 15', 8'' becomes 3815.  Combine that with the longitude. Your result will be 3815/7657 which will be transposed to 381500N0765700W by the FSS website when you finish.
* Click MAP, verify.
* Update contact information.

* Submit.

Congratulations, you just filed a DROTAM!
