#Terms of Service for Commercial Customers (for signing)
This Terms of Service Agreement (the “Agreement”) is between <YOUR-DRONE-BUSINESS> and the “Client”.  This Agreement sets forth the legally binding terms for the Client’s use of our services.

##Mission oriented approach:
The project has two distinct stages: planning & mission. During planning, we take your requirements and develop a mission plan. During mission, we execute the plan.
- Human safety, property safety, and regulations will determine what we can and cannot do. All of of our planning and mission execution will consider those as fundamental things at all times.
- Weather is a factor. Our equipment can only operate when conditions allow it.

##Right to scrub.
Although our interest, and yours, is to see a UAS fly and capture footage, we are dependent on a plethora of external factors. They include FAA regulations, NTSB regulations, state laws, local laws, temporary flight restrictions, airspace requirements, property owners, participant, safety concerns, weather, and so much more which all have to work for us in order to operate a UAS safely and legally. For those reasons and more, we reserve the right to scrub any flight for any reason at any time.

##Mission authority
We appreciate your business and will make an effort to address all concerns and questions ahead of the mission.  On the day of, the pilot of the UAS has the ultimate authority to operate the flight. They are free to alter/scrub/cancel/abort the mission for any reason, especially when safety is a concern.

##Basic Rules
- We will only operate a UAS over an event after a Notice To Airmen (NOTAM) is issued through the FAA.
- You grant us the privilege of placing signage indicating “UAS/Drone Operations In Progress” at the mission site in addition to a reserved area for launching and landing the unmanned aerial system. The reserve area must be at least 25 feet by 25 feet wide.
- Upon setting up, the pilot will conduct a mission briefing, which you must attend.  During the mission, the pilot may exercise “sterile environment” rules. This means that no talking or interruptions are permitted while the UAS is airborne.  
- If our services are for an event, please expect to have a short briefing, in addition to the standard mission briefing, directed at all attendees. This briefing will announce that UAS operations are in progress, introduce the UAS(s) used in the mission, answer immediate questions or concerns, set a tone for the desired behaviors when cameras are pointed at the attendees, and provide an opportunity for anyone to meet and greet the crew after the mission is complete.
- During mission execution, our pilots fly prescribed patterns they have trained for.  Those patterns are designed to maximize safety while providing excellent footage and video quality.
- Once airborne, the crew will fly the agreed on patterns & segments.  Minor adjustments may be made if safety, logistics quality can be improved.
- If the mission is an event, our team will gladly share our enthusiasm, capabilities, and positive advocacy with those interested - after the mission segments are complete.
- We retain your RAW and/or processed footage for 30 days, after-which it is destroyed. We may keep samples for marketing purposes and display them as part of our portfolio.

##Deposits, Fees & Payments
- We will provide a written estimate and payment terms for your project based on the initial scope.  You choose the deliverable:
  - Pilot onsite.
  - RAW pictures or footage.
  - Processed pictures or footage.
  - UAS Consulting Services
- Deposits are required.  A deposit will be taken to secure our availability for the mission.
The deposit becomes non-refundable 48 hours prior to the scheduled mission time.  We do this because our preparation starts before the mission date as we prepare the equipment and satisfy all safety and regulatory requirements.
  - Exception to this is if a pilot, or equipment becomes inoperative, on arrival.  If we have a maintenance or technical issue, we will own that mistake.  
  - Non-exempt are weather, safety, and scope changes. If we cannot fly for any reason other than maintenance or pilot unavailability, the deposit is non-refundable.

##Grounding
The use of Unmanned Aerial Systems, or Drones, can be controversial. Should conflict arise from a 3rd party, the pilots will ground the aircraft until it is deemed safe to fly again.
