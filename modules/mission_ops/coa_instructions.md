#SMALL UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEM (SUAS) WAIVER AND AIRSPACE AUTHORIZATION APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS
Please [submit your application](https://www.faa.gov/uas/request_waiver/) as soon as possible prior to your planned operation.

The FAA will strive to complete review and adjudication of waivers and airspace authorizations within 90 days; however, the time required for the FAA to make a determination regarding waiver/airspace authorization requests will vary based on the complexity of the request. The amount of data and analysis required as part of the application will be proportional to the specific relief that is requested.

* Fully describe proposed mitigations to meet the performance standards for conducting the purposed operation safely.
