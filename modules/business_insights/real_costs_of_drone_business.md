# What are the real costs of a startup Drone (sUAS) Business?
If you are looking to start a drone/sUAS business, and you wish to do it properly, there is some money to be spent.  We offer a simple business model for anyone who has the desire to start their sUAS operations correctly right from the beginning. This model is to help sUAS operators think about the resources required for customer service, safe operations, and competitive advantage.

###If you have ever visited a Japanese restaurant, you may have noticed a bento box on the menu - an assortment of satisfying dishes in one complete package.  DroneBento takes on that spririt, and here is the DroneBento Business (box) for you to sample.

DroneBento is committed to transparancy and an open business concept. We encourage you to take this information, amend it, and use it, to benefit the sUAS industry as a whole. This file is meant to compliment our [blog](https://www.dronebento.com/blog).

## Presence
To get going, your sUAS business will need some basics we see as the startup presence.  Designed to be a virtual hand-shake and a virtual-business card, your online presence plays a major role in gaining clients and serving them. You should form a company, establish an online identity, and provide the means for prospective and current customers to reach you professionally.

## Operating Costs.
To stay in business, there are arguably essential items. Sure, you can pick and choose what to use, but the reality is that any one of these items can give a sUAS business an advantage and should be considered.  Having proper business infrastruture also shows the FAA and Insurance companies that you are a committed and responsibile operator.

    * $144 annually for one user.

  * [BaseCamp](https://basecamp.com/3/pricing).
    * $348 or $948 annually, for the company, depending on your needs.  We don't factor this in our calculations.


# Costs Summary
To start a small UAS (drone) business you need to lay out some cash. Assuming you will operate on your own, out of a home-office, we estimate costs as follows:

| Cost Type        | Notes           | Estimate  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| First Year     | Startup and aircraft | $6700-$12,000 initially|
| Recurring      | Insurance and core apps      |   $2,120-3,120 annually |
| Aircraft Budget | Aircraft maintenance and expansion    |   $1200 annually |

We collected the various costs and created our estimates and based them on a small operation of 1 to 5 crew. In cases where mutliple options were presented, we chose the first one.  We excluded high-end cameras but created a Aircraft budget that is approximately 1/3 of the cost of the aircraft each year for maintenance, upgrades, and expansion.

# Job Pricing.
Everything up to this point considers the initial and recurring costs associated with an establishes sUAS business, and all of it should factor into the sUAS operator's pricing model.  The pricing model shoudl reflect, in our oppinion, everything necessary to run a safe and responsible sUAS operation, provide excellent customer service, and enable the sUAS oprator to make a reasonable and transparent profit.

## Job Costs
Before looking at what to charge for drone services, it is also important to consider the job costs.  Although projects will vary, there are a few key parts - many of which described in our mission documents - that should drive the sUAS operator's pricing structure.

* __Pilot__.  Getting a Private Pilot's License is no small feat, and easily costs $8,000 in most metropolitan areas. Pilots with experience in manned aircraft put a lot on the line to fly unmanned aerial systems.  Although getting a remote operator certificate is now available, it still requires education, dedication, and training.
* __Crew__. Unless operating under an Part 107 waiver, an sUAS operator is required to have a pilot and a visual observer.  Even when a waiver is available, we believe an observer is a reasonable component to a mission. Therefore, each mission has to account for a minimum of two individuals.
* __Aircraft Usage__. The sUAS operator has made a signficiant investment in aircrat built for this mission, each job should help pay for the cost of this quipment, the maintenance, and future upgrades and replacement.
* __Initial Planning__. Initial planning is the scoping of a project which is a time consuming task. As a sUAS operator, you are responsible for safe and responsible operations. Planning goes far into that. It also sets expectations, ensures that a project is on budget, and addresses all legal requirements such as getting additional waivers.
* __Pre-Mission__.  At some point prior to the mission the sUAS operator must file a Drone Notice of Airmen with Fligth Services, charge batteries, and prepare all the equipment.  Effectively, this renders a drone unusable for one or two day prior to a mission.
* __Mission__.  The day of the mission there is travel, waiting, adjustments, and management. A well prepared sUAS operator arrives with a site safety kit, prepares the area, tests the equipment, and flies the mission within specified parameters.
* __Post-Mission__.  Aircraft should be post-flight checked, maintained, and prepared for the next flight. Customer needs a debrief.  Ultimately, the deliverable is a digital product, such as video files, which need to be extracted.  All of this takes time that happens outside of the customer's view.
* __Additional Services__.  Video production and delivery.


## Job Pricing Models
There are an number of ways we have seen sUAS operators charge, with two most common methods being:
* Flat project rate.
* Flat Hourly rate.

We believe both of those methods contribute to the overall misalignment of value that sUAS services provide, and therefore we created our own pricing model based on the following three components:
* The scope of the project.
* Flight time.
* Expenses.

Charging all three proprotionally enables sUAS operators to provide a scalable pay-for-what-you-use model.


### Flat project rate.
This is the method most appealing to many clients.  Althoug it is simple, appealing, and effecitve it tends to de-value sUAS services and is subject to unavoidable scope-creep.

### Flat hourly rate.
A flat hourly rate desirable for the purpose of easy estimates and, just like the flat rate, desirable by clients. However, it fails to encompass the many facets that go into an sUAS operation.

### Pay for Use.
This is our preferred model for sUAS operation pricing. As sUAS operators we invest in infrastructure, aircraft, licensing, skills, and take on massive liability. Despite the simplicity and preponderence of the two options above, we want to inject value and represent the sUAS industry in reaslistic terms.

First, it considers the scope of the project and allows an sUAS operator to immediately associate the scope with the equipment and preparatory work required through a __project rate__. More importantly, it opens the possibility of collecting a deposit which becomes non-refundbale shortly before the project start, in our case it is 48 hours.

At DroneBento, we offer tiered project fees that are tied directly to the camera equipment and sUAS involved in the work.  Clients needing RAW footage will have greater demands, and thus pay a larger initial fee. At the 48 hour mark we are filing DNOTAMs, updating firmware, charging batteries, and mostly securing all equipment for the customer. Since none of it is usable for other projects, this is a fair way to assure that each part meets their obligations.

Second is the __flight time__. Once again, depending on the unit and camera rig, it opens the possibility to tiered pricing.  More importantly, however, is that charging for actual fligth time encourages the customers to participate in effective planning costs, as scope-creep and poor planning are two of the greatest contributors to large invoices.  It fairly compensates the sUAS operator for mission related flying including any preparatory work required to execute complicated missions.  It also puts pressure at the sUAS operator to reduce flight time because they are fairly compensated and cost overruns are bad customer service.  Charging for flight-time also ensures that no additional compensation structure is required for crews.

Third, and last, are expenses. There are three types of expenses that affect any project: disposable items, travel, and idle time. Disposable items may include storage devices for handing over video.  Travel, at DroneBento, can include mileage reimbursement when outside a normal service area.  Idle time is to assure that crews do not sit and wait for the client unnecessarily.


# Job Fee Example
Take a real estate client that wishes to get 30 seconds of usable footage for a house on the market. Usable footage is everything a video produciton company will use to compose the final video.

| Fee Type        | Notes           | Estimate  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Project Fee     | Non-refundable 48 hours before. | $150|
| Engine Time      | $15 per minute for 15 minutes    |   $225 |
| Expenses | None as media will be sent digitally    |   $0 |

Total cost is estimated at $375.
