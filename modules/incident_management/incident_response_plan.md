# Incident Response Plan Framework
What do you do when your commercially operated sUAS has an incident or an accident? Start with having a plan.

## Outline
1. Limit and contain the exposure. Follow the Human/Property/UAS safety priority list and the reaction steps documented.
2. Assemble incident response team.
3. Collect and preserve evidence.
  - Image copy all RAW footage from UAS camera. Offload copies to Amazon S3 storage with redundancy.
  - Image copy all photos/videos from crew camera (or any device used). Offload copies to Amazon S3 storage with redundancy.
4. Establish appropriate chain of custody.
5. Take actions to limit the scope and magnitude of the incident.
6. Investigate
  - Interview crew.
  - Establish contact with witnesses.
7. Review findings and legal implications.
8. Make decisions based on findings.
  - Decide who needs to be notified. FAA? NTSB? NASA?
9. If UAS is no longer needed for evidentiary purposes, hand-off the aircraft to service and maintenance.
  - Verify with legal if any notification must be made with the FAA or any other agency.
  - Assess the state of the equipment. Attempt repairs or initiate repair process with authorized center.
  - Perform maintenance.
  - Test fly the UAS in practice area.
10. Collect time spent and documentation from all involved.
11. Schedule debriefing for 1 week after the incident is resolved.
12. Assess remediation needs.
13. Initiate projects to implement remediation findings.
14. Securely file all records.
15. Decide whether or not to file an ASRS with NASA, http://asrs.arc.nasa.gov/report/electronic.html

#Reporting Accidents
The FAA requires notification of certain sUAS accidents. The applicable FAA regulation states:

>107.9 Accident Reporting. No later than 10 days after an operation that meets the criteria of either paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, a remote pilot in command must report to the Federal Aviation Administration in a manner acceptable to the Administrator, any operation of the small unmanned aircraft involving at least:
a) Serious injury to any person or any loss of consciousness; or
b) Damage to any property, other than the small unmanned aircraft, unless one of the following conditions is satisfied:
1) The cost of repair (including materials and labor) does not exceed $500; or
2) The fair market value of the property does not exceed $500 in the event of total loss.

This report is for small UAS accidents only. If you wish to report unsafe operation of an Unmanned Aircraft, please contact your FAA Regional Operations Center.

The following questionnaire is a collection of information under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The Federal Aviation Administration will use the information you provide in response to the following questions to regulate and promote safety in air commerce, in accordance with its statutory authority 49 U.S.C ยง 44701. The following questions will take approximately 10 minutes to complete. You are not required to respond to this collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
