# Incident Response Plan Framework
What do you do when your commercially operated sUAS has an incident or an accident? Start with having a plan.

## Outline
1. Limit and contain the exposure. Follow the Human/Property/UAS safety priority list and the reaction steps documented.
2. Assemble incident response team.
3. Collect and preserve evidence.
  - Image copy all RAW footage from UAS camera. Offload copies to Amazon S3 storage with redundancy.
  - Image copy all photos/videos from crew camera (or any device used). Offload copies to Amazon S3 storage with redundancy.
4. Establish appropriate chain of custody.
5. Take actions to limit the scope and magnitude of the incident.
6. Investigate
  - Interview crew.
  - Establish contact with witnesses.
7. Review findings and legal implications.
8. Make decisions based on findings.
  - Decide who needs to be notified. FAA? NTSB? NASA?
9. If UAS is no longer needed for evidentiary purposes, hand-off the aircraft to service and maintenance.
  - Verify with legal if any notification must be made with the FAA or any other agency.
  - Assess the state of the equipment. Attempt repairs or initiate repair process with authorized center.
  - Perform maintenance.
  - Test fly the UAS in practice area.
10. Collect time spent and documentation from all involved.
11. Schedule debriefing for 1 week after the incident is resolved.
12. Assess remediation needs.
13. Initiate projects to implement remediation findings.
14. Securely file all records.
15. Decide whether or not to file an ASRS with NASA, http://asrs.arc.nasa.gov/report/electronic.html
