#sUAS Mission Parameters
The general rules for operating sUAS commercially state that a drone operator must keep the aircraft in sight (visual line-of-sight), fly under 400 feet, fly only during the day, fly at or below 100 mph, yield right of way to manned aircraft, cannot NOT fly over people, and cannot NOT fly from a moving vehicle.  From those rules, we form our own General practices which further extend the FAA's regulations.  Another document presents Certificate of Waiver information which grants exception to NPRM 107 commercial operations for many of the requirements listed above.

##General practices
- Flight operations must be conducted at least 400 feet from all nonparticipating persons (persons other than the PIC, SO, operator trainees or essential persons), vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
- Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of the UA, flight operations must cease immediately and/or;
- The aircraft is operated near vessels, vehicles or structures where the owner/controller of such vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission and the PIC has made a safety assessment of the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not present an undue hazard, and;
- Operations nearer to the PIC, SO, operator trainees or essential persons do not present an undue hazard to those persons per § 91.119(a).

##Flight Minimums
- Visibility: Visual Line of Sight at All Times
- Weather: Clear or overcast. Must be able to see clearly as far as the range of the UAS. Operating within Flight Limitations & Procedures outlined in User Manual, A­R listed above, visual meteorological conditions (or VMC), & any Applicable FARs.
- Wind: Max of 12kts from any direction, 0 gusts reported by nearest weather station.
- Forced Landing Safe-Zones:
- Home: clear of obstacles, flat, and size of a standard driveway (10ft x 10ft).  No power lines within 100 feet in any direction.
- Emergency Zone: designated area the UAS can land in the event of malfunction, must be within sight of Home.
- Battery: within 30% of device capability*

##Safety Considerations
- Pilot: at least 1 mission flown in the last 30 days
- Observer: at least 1 observer, in addition to flight to monitor the area.
- Signage: posted indicating UAS activity.
- Communications: Pilot with minimum criteria and experience.

##Pilot/Operator
* PIC holding at least a private pilot’s certificate and a current third-class medical certificate.
* IMSAFE
  * Illness - Is the pilot suffering from any illness or symptom of an illness which might affect them in flight?
  * Medication - Is the pilot currently taking any drugs (prescription or over-the-counter)?
  * Stress - Is the pilot overly worried about other factors in his life? The psychological pressures of everyday living can be a powerful distraction and consequently affect a pilot's performance.
  * Alcohol - Although legal limits vary by jurisdiction (0.04 BAC, any consumption in the past 8 hours or current impairment in the USA), the pilot should consider their alcohol consumption within the last 8 to 24 hours.
  * Fatigue - Has the pilot had sufficient sleep and adequate nutrition?
  * Emotion - Has the pilot fully recovered from any extremely upsetting events such as the loss of a family member?
