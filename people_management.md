#Interacting with People
Customer service goes beyond interacting with the client. sUAS operators need skills to interact with participants and non-participants alike.  That interaction can be fascination, curiosity, or a bird-shot at your sUAS.  Being prepared and having a plan for all scenarios will help in ensuring safe operations.

## Resolving Conflicts
Conflicts are the biggest concern for sUAS operators and come from customers as well as third-parties (non participants).

### Customer interference
Mission / Pilot is interrupted during flight by customer or parties involved in the mission. The pilot may engage the individual, hover the aircraft and address immediate questions, or request “sterile environment” and continue the mission. If the interruption proves unresolvable, the pilot is to initiate the “Return Home” procedure and monitor the arrival. Upon powering down the motors, the pilot and crew may attempt to resolve the situation, request involvement from the crew or support staff, or abort the mission.

### Third-Party interference
Unknown 3rd party during flight, before, or after. Verify the person is unknown. Use best judgement to determine the emotional state of the individual.
* If interested or appearing friendly, refer them to crew or customer representatives and advise you will be free to answer questions shortly after landing. The crew, or customer, can share information about the day’s mission, the UAS, or DroneBento. Key things to remember:
  * Introduce the UAS by it’s nickname and continue to use the nickname thereafter.
  * Advise that safety is the number one priority and that the pilot is to remain free of distractions while the UAS is in the air.
  * Hand over card or brochure.
  * Advise the operator is a certificated pilot.
* If concerned, refer to crew. The crew should do their best to assess the state of the individual and:
  * Introduce the company, their role for the mission, and the certificated pilot operating the UAS.
  * Hand over card or brochure.
  * Advise that safety and concern for the wellness of everyone in the area is the top priority.
  * Politely answer questions or suggest that the individual contact customer service using the contact information provided.
* If agitated, land. Immediately Return Home or initiate automated landing sequence. If able, maintain camera control or directionality on the landing area to record any activity performed by the 3rd party. Maintain safety and security of the landing area. Notify law enforcement if threatened or concerned over safety.
