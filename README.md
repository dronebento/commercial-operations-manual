# Commercial UAS Operations
Best practices for UAS Commercial Operations by DroneBento, Richmond Virginia.  We author procedures and policies for safe and responsible drone operations.

## Getting Started
DroneBento Commercial Operations Manual is modular.  At the current stage we are seeding the files with our internal documents in GitHub's markdown.  You can download the entire library, clone it to your own GitHub repository, or even contribute to our source.  

We are here to develop and grow the UAS operator community.  Although we do operate sUAS in the Richmond area, our goal is to collect knowledge and share it with other operators. We encourage mission sharing, joint-operations, and standardization.  

Currently, the modules being developed are:
- [risk managemen](https://github.com/dronebento/commercial-operations-manual/tree/master/modules/risk_management)
- [training program](https://github.com/dronebento/commercial-operations-manual/tree/master/modules/training_program)
- [mission operations](https://github.com/dronebento/commercial-operations-manual/tree/master/modules/mission_ops)
- [incident management](https://github.com/dronebento/commercial-operations-manual/tree/master/modules/incident_management)
- [maintenance](https://github.com/dronebento/commercial-operations-manual/tree/master/modules/maintenance_program)
