#Maintenance Framework
Proper maintenance of small unmanned aerial systems covers routine maintenance, pre-flight inspection, logging, acceptable use, post-flight inspection, proper storage of the sUAS and the batteries.

##Routine Maintenance Checklist
* Firmware and Software - LATEST
* Aircraft (General) - PHYSICAL INSPECTION, OK
* Battery Capacity, Voltage, & Cell strength. - FULL
* Propellers - PHYSICAL INSPECTION, OK
* Calibration and GPS - 6+ SATELLITES AND NO ERROR
* Vision Positioning System - PHYSICAL INSPECTION, OK
* Video Transmission System - FEED WORKING
* Motors - ALL SPIN
* Gimbal and Camera - FREE AND OPERATING
* IMU - NO ERRORS
* Logs - REVIEW
* Operating hours
* Propeller hours
* Motor hours

##Battery Capacity and Capability:
Periodic testing of motor batteries will be performed on every unit used in mission operations. Training exercise equipment is exempt from testing provided that the UAS is flown in a designated training field.  This is known as a Battery Test Mission.

* Charge to full per recommended requirements.
* Insert battery pack to designated test/training UAS.
* Launch UAS and hover above ground.
* Verify Battery Timer is running.
* Verify video link.
* Monitor battery discharge.
* Land when critical.
* Log time in hover on battery sheet.
* Log the flight.

Batteries should be stored in a fire-proof and explosion proof container.  See http://www.nfpa.org/news-and-research/fire-statistics-and-reports/research-reports/hazardous-materials/other-hazards/lithium-ion-batteries-hazard-and-use-assessment for more.
