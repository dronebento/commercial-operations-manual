# Aviation Safety Reporting System
 The [ASRS (Aviation Safety Reporting System)](http://asrs.arc.nasa.gov/report/electronic.html) is available to pilots of manned and unmanned aircraft. The ASRS is an important facet of the continuing effort by government, industry, and individuals to maintain and improve aviation safety. The ASRS collects voluntarily submitted aviation safety incident/situation reports from pilots, controllers, and others.

## What is it?
Although calling ASRS reports a "get out of jail free" card is often absurd and incorrect, ASRS reports do protect pilots from certain penalties.  ASRS report data is used by the FAA/NASA/NTSB to learn about various dangers in aviation that may otherwise go unreported. The Aviation Safety Reporting System captures confidential reports, analyzes the resulting data, and disseminates vital information to the aviation community.

## Why use ASRS?
The ASRS system is a voluntary and anonymous means of disclosing incidents that may put pilot/operator certificates at risk.  Despite them being anonymous, the submitter keeps a copy, and that copy can be used to reduce/lessen likelyhood of penalties from violations.

## Key notes about ASRS reports
The pertinent facts about ASRS reports are:
- the violation reported must have been inadvertent, not deliberate;
- the violation must not have involved a crime, accident, or lack of qualification or competency on the part of the reporter;
- evidence of having filed an ASRS report within 10 days of the event's occurrence (your receipt) must be presented;
- immunity from action under the ASRS cannot have been used in the last five years.


Filing the report is seen as you demonstrating a constructive attitude regarding the potential infraction, which in turn means that the FAA is less likely to take action against the pilot.
